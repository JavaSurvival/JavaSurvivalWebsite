        <h2>About Java Survival</h2>

        <p>We are a public server dedicated to providing a legitimate semi-vanilla Minecraft experience. Every block has
            been placed the proper way: By hand!</p>
        <p>We strive to maintain the original survival experience, free of gameplay modifications or pay-to-win
            advantages such as teleportation commands, exploits, or game-breaking client mods (with some
            exceptions).</p>
        <p>We don't use many of the same old plugins you're tired of seeing: We've developed our own custom plugins
            which give us our own unique feel.</p>
        <p>We welcome players of age 13 and above, however we are not strictly a "family friendly" community and do
            allow casual swearing.</p>
