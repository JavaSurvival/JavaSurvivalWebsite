        <h2>About Java Survival</h2>
        <p>We are a public server dedicated to providing a legitimate semi-vanilla Minecraft experience. Every block has been placed the proper way: By hand!</p>
        <p>We strive to maintain the original survival experience, free of gameplay modifications or pay-to-win advantages such as teleportation commands, exploits, or game-breaking client mods (with some exceptions).</p>
        <p>We don't use many of the same old plugins you're tired of seeing: We've developed our own custom plugins which give us our own unique feel.</p>
        <p>We welcome players of age 13 and above, however we are not strictly a "family friendly" community and do allow casual swearing.</p>
        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p>The server is currently on its third world, which began on March 28th, 2025.</p>
        <p>The first world was created on November 26th, 2019, and ran until December 17th, 2021.</p>
        <p>The second world began on December 17th, 2021, and ended on March 22nd, 2025.</p>
        <p>All previous worlds can be downloaded <a href="/downloads">here</a>.</p>
