Hello and nice to meet you! Welcome to our Website! We are a multiplayer, survival server known as Java Survival! As a semi-vanilla server, we are dedicated to providing a legitimate Minecraft experience. Every block you see on our server has been mined and/or placed by hand. Our staff members play the game just like everyone else! We also have our own plugins for basic commands and land protections that make us stand out from other servers. We hold staff-and player-run events and are very active on Discord too!

In addition to providing an authentic, unique experience, we are committed to building and maintaining a safe and welcoming community for everyone! Our server has no age restriction or whitelist, so you will meet people from many different backgrounds. We are helpful and friendly to each other, giving you a “welcome to the server!” or “welcome back!” message when you log in. Many of our players have even made long-lasting friendships here. Whether you’re a Minecraft veteran who makes intricate mega-builds and redstone projects or completely new to the game and building dirt huts, there is a place for you on Java Survival!
